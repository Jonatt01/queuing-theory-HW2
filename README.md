homework 2 - model simulation

M/M/1 model, M/M/2 model
- Mean waiting time v.s. λ 
- Mean Queue length v.s. λ 

M/M/1/k model
-  Mean Queue length v.s. λ
-  Mean Blocking rate v.s. k (with λ=2 and 3)


Note: Mean Queue length will be more accurate by using PASTA (observe the system at the time packets come and then divide by the total packet number)
